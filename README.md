# Wings.ai Forecast Data

This is source code I used to collect wings.ai forecast data and calculated weighted median
forecast value for for each project. Use data/forecast_snapshot.json for quick start. If you
want to get actual data run `run fetch_forecast` command.

# Rich data
Here http://bit.ly/2jA1LHg is spreadsheet with basic parameters of ICOs listed on wings.ai

## How to prepare environment

Clone repo and run `make build` command.
